Testing, Style, and Self-Evaluation (Task 13-15):

Completed self-evaluation form includes test cases and outcomes.
Emphasis on coding best practices: comments, indentation, meaningful variable names, method reusability, constants usage, etc.
GitHub Repository:
The repository houses Java source files (Theatre.java, Person.java, Ticket.java), test cases, output screenshots, and the completed self-evaluation form. Commits document implemented features, bug fixes, and coding style improvements. The README.md file provides project overview, instructions for executing the program, and the purpose of the self-evaluation form.

This GitHub repository showcases expertise in Java programming, array manipulation, encapsulation, and algorithm implementation, specifically tailored for theater management. It demonstrates adherence to coding best practices, robust project structuring, and thorough testing
